message: 'CLI skeleton implementation complete. The CLI already existed with a full
  Typer-based implementation (Typer is built on Click). Fixed the entry point: renamed
  Typer callback from `main` to `_main_callback` and added a proper `main()` function
  that calls `app()` so the pyproject.toml entry point works correctly. All 198 tests
  pass (87% coverage). The analyze command with --dir and --output options works without
  error. Version flag prints version correctly.'
