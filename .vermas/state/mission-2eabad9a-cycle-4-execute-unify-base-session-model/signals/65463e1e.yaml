message: Unified BaseSession into single model with all fields. Moved AgentSignal,
  AgentLearning, KnowledgeImprovement from parsers/vermas.py to parsers/models.py.
  Added task_description, signals, learnings, improvements, quality_assessment (QualityAssessment),
  and cycle_info (CycleInfo) fields to BaseSession. Updated VermasSession to inherit
  from unified BaseSession. Updated formatter to use direct attribute access instead
  of getattr. Updated all imports across parsers, formatters, models, and tests. All
  218 tests pass.
