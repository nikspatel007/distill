message: 'CLI wiring was already complete. Verified: (1) core.py has discover_sessions()
  detecting .claude/.codex/.vermas directories, (2) core.py has parse_session_file()
  routing to ClaudeParser/CodexParser/VermasParser, (3) cli.py analyze command uses
  these functions. 183/185 tests pass (2 failures are pre-existing VermasSession duration
  tracking issues unrelated to CLI wiring). Tested CLI on real data: successfully
  detected and parsed sessions from all 3 sources.'
