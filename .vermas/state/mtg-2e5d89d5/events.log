Full consensus on 4-phase execution plan: Phase 0 (commit working tree + KPI wiring + admin), Phase A (recover 3 standalone test files ~1,266 LOC), Phase B (manual merge modified files ~650 LOC), Phase C (worktree recovery ~775 LOC), Phase D stretch (project_detection measurer). 7 action items created. Success criteria: 300+ tests on main, tests_pass KPI > 0, no regressions.
