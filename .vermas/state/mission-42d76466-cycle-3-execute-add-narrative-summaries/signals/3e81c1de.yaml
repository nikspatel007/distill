message: Dev agent (pane 0) Claude Code session ended mid-implementation. Partial
  changes on disk (obsidian.py +7 lines, templates.py +1 line) but not committed.
  Narrative module not created, tests not written, frontmatter wiring incomplete.
  Dev agent cannot receive messages - session is at shell prompt. QA correctly signaled
  needs_revision (no committed changes). Need dev agent restart to continue.
