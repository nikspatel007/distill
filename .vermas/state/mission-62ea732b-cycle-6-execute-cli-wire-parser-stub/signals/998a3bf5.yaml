message: 'QA: requirements not met. CLI still prints ''Found {total} session file(s)''
  and per-source counts; spec requires ''Found sources: .claude, .vermas'' and dot-prefixed
  dir names. Also cli.py does not import from parsers/ directory (only core), contrary
  to requirement. No new tests for source discovery output. No code changes vs main
  (git diff main...HEAD empty).'
