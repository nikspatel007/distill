message: 'Wired CLI to parser discovery. Changes:

  1. Added explicit parser imports in cli.py: `from session_insights.parsers import
  ClaudeParser, CodexParser, VermasParser`

  2. Created new `sources` command that discovers and prints available sources in
  format: "Found sources: .claude, .vermas"

  3. Updated `analyze` command to also print discovered sources before processing

  4. Added 5 new tests for the sources command - all pass

  5. All 9 CLI tests pass (187 total tests pass, 2 pre-existing failures in vermas
  parser tests unrelated to these changes)'
