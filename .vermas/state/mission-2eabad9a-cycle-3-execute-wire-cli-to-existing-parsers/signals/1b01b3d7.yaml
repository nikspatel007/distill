message: 'Wired CLI to all three parsers. Changes in commit b3f6789: (1) Updated sessions_cmd
  to use core discover_sessions()/parse_sessions() instead of direct parser instantiation,
  adding .vermas/ support alongside .claude/ and .codex/. (2) Removed direct ClaudeParser/CodexParser
  imports from cli.py in favor of core module dispatch. (3) Added integration tests
  (test_cli_wiring.py) verifying all three source types are discovered and parsed
  by both analyze and sessions commands. All 225 tests pass.'
