message: 'Implemented narrative_quality KPI measurer and narrative generation. Changes:
  (1) Added _generate_narrative to ClaudeParser that combines summary, outcomes, tools,
  and tags into 1-2 sentence narratives. (2) Added _generate_narrative to VermasParser
  that combines task description, outcome, roles, and quality rating. (3) Created
  NarrativeQualityMeasurer in measurers/narrative_quality.py that checks narratives
  are non-empty, >10 words, and differ from summary. (4) Added 25 unit tests covering
  both narrative generation and the measurer. All 420 tests pass. Commit: b7c6ca53.'
