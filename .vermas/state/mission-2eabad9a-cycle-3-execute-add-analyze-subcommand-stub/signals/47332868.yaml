message: "QA found requirement mismatch: analyze command still runs full parsing/output\
  \ pipeline and exposes many options, but task requires stub with only --dir that\
  \ prints 'Analyzing: <path>' and exits (no parsing). Tests added don\u2019t assert\
  \ stub behavior. See src/session_insights/cli.py:185-209. Please short-circuit/strip\
  \ logic and adjust tests accordingly."
