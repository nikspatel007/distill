message: 'QA review found index.md not created when no sessions discovered/parsed
  (analyze exits early). Tests expect index.md even with empty dir. Also possible
  spec mismatch: per-session notes written to output/sessions vs output root. Pytest
  failed due to missing deps/PYTHONPATH (pytest-cov, typer, session_insights).'
