states:
  start:
    type: initial
    auto_transition: validate

  validate:
    instructions: |
      Before implementing anything, validate the execution environment.
      
      Run these checks IN ORDER and report any failures:
      
      1. Verify Python environment:
         `uv run python --version`
         Expected: Python 3.11 or higher
      
      2. Verify project structure exists:
         - Check if pyproject.toml exists
         - Check if src/ directory exists
         - If pyproject.toml is missing, this project needs setup first
      
      3. Verify dependencies can be installed:
         `uv sync`
      
      4. Verify pytest works:
         `uv run pytest --version`
      
      If ALL checks pass, signal "done".
      
      If ANY check fails:
      - Report the specific failure in your signal message
      - Signal "blocked" with details about what failed
    on_signal:
      done:
        from: engineer
        next: engineering
      blocked:
        from: engineer
        next: blocked
    timeout:
      duration: 5m
      action: fail

  engineering:
    instructions: |
      Implement the assigned task for the session-insights CLI tool.
      
      Follow Python best practices:
      - Use Pydantic v2 for models
      - Click for CLI commands
      - pytest for testing
      - Type hints throughout
      
      Run tests before signaling done:
      `uv run pytest tests/ -x -q`
      
      If tests fail, fix them before signaling.
      
      Signal "done" when implementation is complete and tests pass.
      Signal "blocked" if you encounter infrastructure issues.
    on_signal:
      done:
        from: engineer
        next: reviewing
      blocked:
        from: engineer
        next: blocked
    timeout:
      duration: 30m
      action: nudge

  reviewing:
    instructions: |
      Review the implementation for correctness and quality.
      
      Verification steps:
      1. Read all changed files
      2. Run full test suite with coverage
      3. Test CLI manually if applicable
      4. Check for edge cases and error handling
      
      Signal "approved" if quality is acceptable.
      Signal "needs_revision" with specific feedback if changes needed.
    on_signal:
      approved:
        from: reviewer
        next: finalize
      needs_revision:
        from: reviewer
        next: engineering
    timeout:
      duration: 15m
      action: nudge

  blocked:
    type: terminal
    on_entry:
      - action: log
        message: "Workflow blocked - environment validation failed or infrastructure issue"

  finalize:
    type: terminal
    on_entry:
      - action: commit
