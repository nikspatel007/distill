change: "The workflow's engineering state instructions were truncated and lack critical\
  \ guardrails identified across 5+ cycles of failures. Key changes: (1) Add explicit\
  \ KPI-awareness \u2014 every task must map to a KPI before implementation begins,\
  \ addressing the 96% task completion / 35% KPI progress gap. (2) Add a 'build measurers\
  \ first' priority since 4/5 KPIs have no automated measurers. (3) Add CLI-specific\
  \ decomposition guidance since CLI was flagged as high-risk in cycle-4-6. (4) Add\
  \ a circuit-breaker rule: if the engineer cannot make progress after 2 attempts,\
  \ signal 'blocked' instead of retrying indefinitely (addressing cycles 4-7, 1-2,\
  \ 1-5 escalation pattern). (5) Add the quick test fix as a first-action priority\
  \ to unblock tests_pass KPI. (6) Reviewing state now requires the reviewer to verify\
  \ KPI linkage, not just code quality."
