change: 'The engineer agent definition is generic and doesn''t reflect the current
  mission phase. Two key additions: (1) Explicit guidance on building automated measurers,
  since the agent has been completing feature tasks without measurement infrastructure.
  (2) CLI decomposition pattern, since CLI work has been flagged as high-risk across
  multiple cycles. These additions align the agent''s standing instructions with the
  evidence without changing its core identity.'
