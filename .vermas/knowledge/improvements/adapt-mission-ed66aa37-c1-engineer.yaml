change: 'The engineer agent definition is too generic and doesn''t address the core
  failure patterns: (1) no KPI awareness, (2) no circuit-breaker behavior for repeated
  failures, (3) no guidance on building measurers. Adding these to the agent definition
  ensures the behavior persists across workflow versions. The 49/51 task completion
  rate with 35% KPI progress proves the engineer executes tasks but doesn''t connect
  them to outcomes.'
