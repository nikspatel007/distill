change: "The current workflow's engineering instructions emphasize 'no more scaffolding'\
  \ and list a priority order, but note_content_richness (0%) is the dominant bottleneck\
  \ blocking overall KPI progress. 31 of 37 historically completed tasks failed to\
  \ move this metric because tasks default to infrastructure work. The instructions\
  \ need to: (1) elevate note_content_richness as the #1 priority with explicit guidance\
  \ on the data pipeline path (parser \u2192 structured metadata \u2192 formatter\
  \ \u2192 rich output), (2) require that every task maps to at least one KPI before\
  \ execution begins, (3) add a mandatory root cause analysis step before retrying\
  \ any previously failed task (per cycle-2-8 learning), and (4) keep the low-volume/high-alignment\
  \ execution model that produced the 20-point KPI jump. The reviewing instructions\
  \ should also validate KPI alignment, not just code quality."
