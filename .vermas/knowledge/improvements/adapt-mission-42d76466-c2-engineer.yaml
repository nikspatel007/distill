change: 'The engineer agent definition is too generic - it mentions TDD and clean
  code but provides no guidance on KPI-targeted work, measurement-first approaches,
  or the specific failure patterns observed (CLI skeleton blocking, monolithic tasks,
  estimation instead of measurement). Adding explicit measurement workflow and task
  decomposition guidance directly addresses the top failure modes: (1) building without
  validating, (2) working on too-broad tasks, (3) reporting estimates instead of measurements.'
