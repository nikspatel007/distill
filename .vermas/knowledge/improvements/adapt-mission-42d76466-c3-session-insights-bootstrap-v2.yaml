change: "The current engineering instructions focus on 'validation mode' but lack\
  \ three critical elements identified by the evidence: (1) Zero KPIs have automated\
  \ measurers \u2014 the single biggest blocker identified in learnings and evaluation\
  \ suggestions. The instructions must make building automated measurers the explicit\
  \ top priority. (2) Project detection accuracy has the largest gap to target (80%\
  \ vs 95%) \u2014 the instructions should call out specific edge cases (monorepos,\
  \ symlinks, nested projects). (3) CLI implementation is flagged as high-risk (cycle\
  \ 4-6 learning) \u2014 any CLI work must be decomposed into layers. (4) The reviewing\
  \ state needs a measurer-validation gate: the reviewer should verify that measurer\
  \ output matches claimed KPI values, since cycle 5-6 flagged that KPIs were measuring\
  \ the wrong things. (5) Added a circuit breaker: if KPI progress stalls for 2 consecutive\
  \ cycles, escalate rather than retry."
