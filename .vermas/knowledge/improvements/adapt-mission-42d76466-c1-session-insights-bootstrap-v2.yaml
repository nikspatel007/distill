change: "The workflow instructions are stuck in construction-phase priorities (build\
  \ measurers, fix blocking tests). Evidence shows measurers are built and tests are\
  \ passing (0 failures). The consistent pattern of deferring validation work means\
  \ the workflow must explicitly front-load running measurers against real data. Additionally,\
  \ the 100% KPI targets for project_notes and weekly_digests are untested and high-risk\
  \ \u2014 the workflow should force early stress-testing of these. Finally, the 5\
  \ pending + 1 in-progress tasks from the previous cycle should be treated as the\
  \ starting backlog rather than regenerating tasks."
