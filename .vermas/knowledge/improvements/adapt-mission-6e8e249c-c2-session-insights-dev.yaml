change: The CLI skeleton task has failed in consecutive cycles (100% failure rate
  for monolithic CLI tasks). Evidence from cycle-4-6, cycle-5-4, and multiple learnings
  indicates CLI tasks must be decomposed into argument parsing, dispatch, and logic
  layers. The current workflow instructions don't enforce this decomposition or provide
  diagnostic requirements before retrying failed tasks. Adding explicit CLI decomposition
  requirements and mandatory diagnostic steps addresses the root cause identified
  across 5+ cycles.
