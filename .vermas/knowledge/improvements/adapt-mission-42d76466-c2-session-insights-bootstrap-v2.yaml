change: 'The engineering state instructions are truncated and lack critical guidance
  identified across multiple cycles: (1) agents must run automated KPI measurers before
  and after work to provide measured data instead of estimates, (2) tests_pass must
  be prioritized as the first KPI target, (3) tasks must be decomposed into KPI-specific
  subtasks rather than monolithic remediation blocks. The reviewing state needs explicit
  instructions to verify measured KPI data is included in cycle reports. Adding a
  circuit-breaker timeout that escalates after 2 more cycles without reaching 60%
  KPI progress, per the learning from cycle-4-7.'
