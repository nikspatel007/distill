    learnings:
    - Dev agent process terminated or crashed before establishing MCP communication
      with the workflow orchestrator
    - No signals or events were recorded by the dev agent, indicating failure happened
      during initialization rather than task execution
    - The 548-second duration matches the full workflow timeout, suggesting no early
      failure detection mechanism triggered
