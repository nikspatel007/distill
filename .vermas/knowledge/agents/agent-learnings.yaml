agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent responded quickly to QA feedback (under 2 minutes per revision cycle),
      demonstrating effective understanding of specific feedback
    - 'QA agent correctly caught a subtle issue: removing imports fixed lint but violated
      task requirements - showing requirement-aware review'
    - Watcher agent tracked workflow state transitions, providing audit trail but
      not actively intervening in dev-QA loop
