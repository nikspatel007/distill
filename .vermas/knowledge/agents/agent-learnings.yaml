agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent completed substantial implementation work (parser code + models +
      17 tests) but failed to maintain heartbeat during the final phase, resulting
      in premature termination
    - The tmux session 'vermas-agents-e-parser-d176' was terminated, suggesting either
      the agent process crashed or was killed by workflow timeout
    - No workflow signals were recorded for implement-claude-parser (unlike successful
      workflows which show dev done -> QA approved -> dev complete signal chain)
