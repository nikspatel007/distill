agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent was responsive to QA feedback, shipping revised code within 2-3 minutes
      of each revision request, but over-signaled completion (3 redundant 'done' signals
      for the same fix).
    - QA agent provided high-quality, specific revision requests that identified both
      functional (stub vs full pipeline) and operational (entrypoint wiring) issues,
      demonstrating multi-layer verification.
    - "The two-agent dev+QA loop completed in 15 minutes with 2 revision cycles \u2014\
      \ the revision overhead (~10 min) was justified by catching real issues that\
      \ would have caused post-merge failures."
