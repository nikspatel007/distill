    learnings:
    - Dev agent provided comprehensive coverage breakdown (8 modules with individual
      percentages), enabling future targeted improvements
    - QA agent independently ran the exact same pytest command rather than trusting
      dev's output, demonstrating proper verification protocol
    - Both agents efficiently completed their roles within 163 seconds total - verification
      tasks should be quick
