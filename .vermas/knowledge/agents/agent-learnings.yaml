    learnings:
    - "Dev agent delivered high-quality, well-structured code with 20 comprehensive\
      \ tests covering edge cases (truncation, empty sessions, disabled conversation\
      \ flag) \u2014 demonstrating strong implementation capability when requirements\
      \ are specific and measurable (KPI target)."
    - "QA agent (codex) correctly identified the initial empty branch state and later\
      \ validated all requirements against the task description, but did not catch\
      \ that the code would not be merged to main \u2014 QA scope is limited to code\
      \ correctness, not deployment pipeline verification."
    - "Watcher agent generated the largest trace (353KB, 159 lines) but its contribution\
      \ to the outcome is unclear \u2014 the workflow succeeded based on dev-QA signaling\
      \ alone, suggesting watcher may add overhead without proportional value for\
      \ focused implementation tasks."
