    learnings:
    - Dev agent (Claude) delivered 492 LOC implementation in ~6 minutes with proper
      direct-to-main commit (97e5f081), following the established mandate and avoiding
      the merge-drops-source failure pattern that has occurred 9+ times previously.
    - QA agent (Codex) provided genuinely valuable feedback catching real requirement
      gaps (core.py pipeline wiring, missing formatter sections, coverage calculation
      logic) rather than stylistic or trivial issues, demonstrating QA adds value
      beyond verification.
    - "The early QA review before dev signaled done (08:15:04 vs dev done at 08:18:50)\
      \ created unnecessary noise but also demonstrated QA's proactive monitoring\
      \ \u2014 the workflow should gate QA on dev's done signal to eliminate this\
      \ waste."
