    learnings:
    - "Dev agent responded effectively to QA's needs_revision signal, producing 849\
      \ LOC of comprehensive integration tests covering all 4 requested areas (rich\
      \ content, VerMAS fields, Claude fields, exit codes) in a single revision cycle\
      \ \u2014 demonstrating the dev-QA feedback loop works when QA provides specific,\
      \ actionable feedback."
    - "QA agent correctly identified the initial empty worktree state and provided\
      \ a detailed list of missing test coverage areas, then verified the revision\
      \ met all requirements before approving \u2014 showing disciplined review that\
      \ neither rubber-stamps nor blocks unnecessarily."
    - The watcher/merge agent continues to produce artifact-only commits that strip
      source files, operating as a silent failure point that neither dev nor QA can
      detect until post-merge review. This agent's merge logic is the root cause of
      the project's largest systemic issue.
