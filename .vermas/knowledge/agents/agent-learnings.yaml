agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent provided comprehensive completion summaries including file changes,
      verification commands, and test counts - this accelerated QA verification
    - 'QA agent (Codex) used simple but effective verification: running tests and
      checking --help output were sufficient for project skeleton validation'
    - Three-agent setup (dev/watcher/qa) with clear handoff signals kept workflow
      organized despite potential coordination complexity
