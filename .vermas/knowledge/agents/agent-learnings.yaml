    learnings:
    - "Dev agent was productive (770+ LOC written) but failed at the delivery step\
      \ \u2014 the work was done in a worktree and never committed to main, making\
      \ it invisible to QA and the git history. Capability is not the bottleneck;\
      \ commit discipline is."
    - QA agent performed thorough requirements-based review, correctly identifying
      6+ missing test scenarios and the environment-dependent Path.home() issue. The
      QA signal was well-structured with specific file references and actionable feedback.
    - "The dev agent likely signaled 'done' without running the pre-signal-check.sh\
      \ script, or the script failed to detect the uncommitted worktree state \u2014\
      \ either way, the workflow's safety net did not catch the problem before QA\
      \ had to reject."
