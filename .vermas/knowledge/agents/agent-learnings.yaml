    learnings:
    - QA agent identified a subtle but blocking issue (gitignore conflict) that would
      have caused the fixture file to be untracked in version control - demonstrating
      the value of thorough review beyond just 'tests pass'
    - Dev agent responded to revision feedback quickly (90 seconds) with a targeted
      fix, showing effective handling of specific QA feedback
    - The watcher/orchestration properly captured the complete signal flow (done ->
      needs_revision -> done -> approved -> complete) enabling audit trail
