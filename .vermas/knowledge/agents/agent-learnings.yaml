    learnings:
    - Dev successfully iterated through 2 revision cycles in response to QA feedback,
      fixing framework choice and adding missing CLI options
    - QA effectively caught both framework compliance issues (Click vs Typer) and
      functional gaps (missing --since option)
    - Watcher correctly tracked workflow progress and final completion, but couldn't
      prevent session termination
