    learnings:
    - Dev agent delivered substantial code (1380+ lines total) in a single implementation
      pass, demonstrating ability to handle complex multi-class implementations without
      iteration.
    - The workflow properly committed code to main branch, addressing the systemic
      issue from previous cycles where code was written but left uncommitted in worktrees.
    - Test coverage follows good patterns with edge case handling (empty input, below-threshold
      input) and multiple scenario tests per analyzer.
