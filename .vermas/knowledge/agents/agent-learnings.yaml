agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent successfully implemented complete functionality (372-line parser,
      391-line test file) but failed to preserve work through commits
    - Agent may have spent too much time on implementation without intermediate checkpoints
      or heartbeats
    - No evidence of QA involvement - workflow failed before dev could signal completion
      to trigger QA review
