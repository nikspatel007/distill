agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - "Dev agent successfully responded to QA revision within 8 minutes, implementing\
      \ 620+ LOC across measurer, formatter, and tests \u2014 demonstrating effective\
      \ revision response when given specific feedback"
    - QA agent (codex) provided actionable feedback identifying exactly what was missing
      (no measurer implementation, missing required sections) rather than vague complaints,
      enabling targeted fixes
    - "Watcher agent generated 159 lines of trace data but the workflow still resulted\
      \ in code on branch rather than main \u2014 the watcher role does not prevent\
      \ the recurring merge-drops-source failure"
