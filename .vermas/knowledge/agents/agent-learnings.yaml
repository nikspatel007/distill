    learnings:
    - "Dev agent produced high-quality code (+269 LOC with 225 tests passing) on the\
      \ task branch, demonstrating that the implementation capability is not the bottleneck\
      \ \u2014 the merge process is."
    - QA agent correctly detected the artifact-only commit initially (needs_revision
      signal) but then accepted dev's verbal claim of branch-level work without verifying
      the main-branch state, undermining the detection system.
    - Post-workflow, three previously-stalled action items (spanning 3+ review cycles)
      were finally executed as direct commits, suggesting that treating action items
      as standalone fixes rather than workflow-routed tasks breaks the execution stall
      pattern.
