agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - 'Dev agent completed implementation work (claude.py: 12KB, models.py: 1.4KB
      created) but failed to execute the critical git add/commit workflow step'
    - QA agent correctly identified missing implementation but could have distinguished
      between 'not created' vs 'created but not committed' by checking worktree file
      existence
    - Agent termination occurred during revision cycle, suggesting potential timeout
      or resource issues when handling QA feedback
