    learnings:
    - 'Dev agent performed well: implemented 1,268 LOC across 9 source files with
      50 tests in approximately 8 minutes. Architecture was sound with clean module
      separation. The implementation directly addressed the stated problem (core features
      stalled at 0% despite 48 ''completed'' tasks).'
    - "QA agent correctly identified missing functionality in initial review (needs_revision\
      \ signal at 06:34), then properly approved after dev delivered. However, QA\
      \ did not verify that code survived the merge to main \u2014 approval was based\
      \ on worktree state, not main branch state."
    - "Watcher agent correctly orchestrated the workflow timeline and agent notifications\
      \ but the final merge/commit step systematically dropped source code, producing\
      \ an artifact-only commit. The watcher's 'complete' signal was premature \u2014\
      \ it should have verified main branch diff before concluding."
