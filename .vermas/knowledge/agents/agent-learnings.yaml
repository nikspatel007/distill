    learnings:
    - QA agent (Codex) provided highly specific, actionable feedback with exact technical
      details (e.g., '_convert_parser_session_to_base does not map parser messages
      to BaseSession.turns') rather than vague descriptions.
    - "Dev agent (Claude) responded to each QA issue with targeted fixes and incremental\
      \ test additions (103\u2192106 tests), demonstrating good iterative development\
      \ practice."
    - Watcher agent provided useful final summary but was passive during the dev-QA
      review cycles - consider having watcher monitor for review loops that exceed
      thresholds.
