agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - All agents died simultaneously, suggesting infrastructure failure (tmux session
      death) rather than individual agent issues. No agent-specific behavioral patterns
      can be extracted.
    - The existing task-patterns.yaml already contains 'task-planning/*' insight noting
      cli.py exists - this knowledge was not applied when scheduling this workflow.
    - No agents registered before failure occurred, indicating the failure happened
      at the infrastructure layer during workflow initialization or very early in
      execution.
