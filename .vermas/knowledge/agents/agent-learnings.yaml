agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - No agents were spawned in this 3-second workflow - failure occurred at infrastructure
      layer before agent registration
    - Prior cycles showed agents perform well when infrastructure is stable, suggesting
      this failure is environmental rather than agent-related
