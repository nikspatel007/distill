agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent provided detailed done signal with implementation specifics (6 tests
      passing, exact changes made), enabling efficient QA review without back-and-forth
      clarification.
    - QA agent identified environment-specific test behavior (PYTHONPATH requirement)
      and documented it in approval message, preventing future confusion.
    - Three-agent setup (dev, watcher, qa) with codex-based QA enabled automated verification
      even though the watcher agent role was minimal in this short cycle.
