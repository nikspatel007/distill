agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - The dev agent produced a commit that claimed implementation but contained no
      source code changes, indicating it may have confused workflow artifact generation
      with actual code delivery.
    - The QA agent or watcher did not catch the artifact-only commit before the done
      signal was sent, suggesting the verification pipeline has gaps that allow false
      positives.
    - The three-agent coordination (dev, watcher, qa) completed quickly (362s) but
      speed without substance indicates the agents may have short-circuited actual
      implementation work.
