    learnings:
    - "The dev agent successfully wrote meaningful code (200 LOC across 4 files: weekly\
      \ formatter sections, parser project-name fallback, updated tests) but failed\
      \ at the merge-to-main step \u2014 the same failure mode seen in 11 prior cycles.\
      \ The coding capability is not the issue; the git workflow is."
    - "The QA agent performed correctly: it detected 'no code or test changes on this\
      \ branch' and issued a needs_revision signal at 08:50:57. However, the signal\
      \ was not actionable \u2014 the workflow completed anyway with artifact-only\
      \ commit a3e2ac48, indicating the QA gate is advisory, not blocking."
    - The watcher agent produced a 354KB trace (larger than the dev agent's 224KB
      trace) but did not intervene to prevent the artifact-only merge. A watcher that
      validates 'git diff HEAD~1..HEAD -- src/ tests/' before allowing completion
      would have caught this.
