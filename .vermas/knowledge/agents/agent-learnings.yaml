agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent completed substantial implementation work (2 production files with
      clean architecture) but consistently fails at the git commit step, indicating
      a priority issue in agent task execution order
    - The pattern of incomplete test coverage suggests the agent optimizes for 'working
      code' over 'task checklist completion' - test files are frequently deprioritized
    - Agent did not create tests/parsers/ directory at all, suggesting the task decomposition
      may not be explicit enough about directory structure requirements
