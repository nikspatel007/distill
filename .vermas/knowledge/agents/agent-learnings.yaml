    learnings:
    - 'The dev agent delivered a substantial initial implementation quickly (1403
      LOC across 9 files) but made a conceptual error: measuring model fields instead
      of generated output. This suggests dev agents may optimize for code volume over
      requirement fidelity on first pass.'
    - "The QA agent provided highly specific, actionable feedback in both revision\
      \ rounds \u2014 citing exact field names, section markers, and even documenting\
      \ the test commands it tried (including PYTHONPATH workarounds). This specificity\
      \ enabled fast dev turnaround."
    - The QA agent caught a subtle semantic distinction (task_description 'present'
      vs 'present and non-empty') that the dev agent missed twice, demonstrating QA's
      value for specification compliance beyond basic functionality testing.
