    learnings:
    - "Dev agent correctly applied Gate 0 thinking \u2014 investigated whether the\
      \ bug actually existed before writing fix code, discovering the logic was already\
      \ correct and only tests were needed."
    - QA agent (codex model) provided fast, specific feedback identifying missing
      deliverables and a tooling issue (pytest-cov plugin missing), enabling a focused
      revision cycle.
    - The 3-minute turnaround between QA needs_revision and dev done signal shows
      efficient agent responsiveness in the multi-agent workflow.
