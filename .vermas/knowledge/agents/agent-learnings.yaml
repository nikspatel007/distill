agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent demonstrated effective forensic debugging by investigating worktree
      contents of a prior 'failed' mission before starting new work, discovering completed
      code that just needed committing
    - QA agent caught subtle issues (untracked test files, unjustified pragmas) that
      dev missed, demonstrating value of the review cycle even when dev reports high
      coverage
    - Dev responded to QA feedback comprehensively in one revision cycle, addressing
      all 4 concerns (git add, justification comments, 7 new edge case tests, verification)
      without multiple back-and-forth
