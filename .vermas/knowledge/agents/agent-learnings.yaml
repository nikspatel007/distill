    learnings:
    - Dev agent successfully executed recovery strategy (worktree file checkout to
      main) rather than reimplementation, breaking a 5+ cycle failure pattern on this
      specific task.
    - QA agent performed rapid independent verification (~30 seconds) by running the
      specific test file in isolation before checking full suite, demonstrating efficient
      focused validation.
    - "The watcher agent correctly finalized the workflow within 25 seconds of QA\
      \ approval, showing tight coordination between the three-agent pipeline (dev\
      \ \u2192 qa \u2192 watcher)."
