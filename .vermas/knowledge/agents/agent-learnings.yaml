    learnings:
    - "Dev agent was highly productive \u2014 540 LOC across 8 files with 39 tests\
      \ in ~8 minutes \u2014 but failed to follow the direct-to-main commit mandate,\
      \ resulting in code stranded on a branch for the 12th time."
    - Watcher agent provided a single progress signal at the start but did not detect
      or flag that the dev's commit went to a branch instead of main, missing its
      monitoring purpose.
    - QA agent (Codex) was configured but appears to have had minimal interaction
      window given the fast dev completion; the workflow concluded before meaningful
      QA review could occur.
