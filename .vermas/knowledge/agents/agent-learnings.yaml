agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent shows pattern of completing code implementation but failing at the
      commit step, suggesting the commit workflow is not sufficiently prioritized
      or time-budgeted
    - Agent death occurred after QA requested revision, indicating revision handling
      may be more resource-intensive than initial implementation
    - The 248-second duration suggests the agent was actively working when it died,
      not idle - possibly ran out of turns or hit a timeout
    strengths: []
    weaknesses: []
    best_practices:
    - Dev agents must run `git status` and verify no untracked implementation files remain before signaling done
    - QA agents should check for untracked files in src/ and tests/, not just rely on "nothing to commit" status
    prompt_tips:
    - Add explicit instruction: "Before signaling done, run git status. If any files in src/ or tests/ are untracked, git add and commit them."
