agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - QA agent provided high-value feedback by testing actual user-facing features
      (--include-conversation) rather than just checking code structure, catching
      two critical bugs the dev agent missed.
    - "Dev agent showed strong iteration skills: received specific QA feedback and\
      \ delivered targeted fixes in under 3 minutes per cycle, maintaining test count\
      \ growth (103\u2192106) throughout."
    - Both agents recognized and documented the pytest-cov environment issue, sharing
      the workaround (PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest -q -o addopts='') rather than
      getting stuck.
