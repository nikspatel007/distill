    learnings:
    - QA agent (Codex) provided highly specific issue lists with exact failure points
      (missing dispatch, missing tests, missing conversion) which enabled targeted
      dev fixes without ambiguity
    - Dev agent completed fixes within single revision cycles by addressing all QA
      points systematically rather than partially
    - Watcher agent coordinated meeting-based debugging for worktree status issues,
      enabling proactive identification of uncommitted implementation work
