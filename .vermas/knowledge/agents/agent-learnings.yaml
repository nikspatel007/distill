    learnings:
    - Dev agent demonstrated strong implementation ability (800+ line parser with
      1170 lines of tests) but failed to survive the full QA revision cycle
    - QA agent caught real issues (missing workflow YAML parsing, recaps, memory files,
      unbound variable) showing effective review process
    - Both agents engaged in productive feedback loop until dev death - the collaboration
      pattern was working
