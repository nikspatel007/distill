    learnings:
    - 'The dev agent (collaboration role) effectively ran a debug meeting solo when
      no other participants joined (broadcast_count: 0), investigating artifacts,
      identifying root cause, and creating 3 action items within ~2 minutes of investigation.'
    - The watcher agent (dev role) performed thorough real-data validation by running
      the parser against 16,522 sessions, correctly distinguishing data quality issues
      (empty files, summary-only sessions) from parser failures, and providing precise
      three-tier KPI measurements.
    - Both agents operated in meeting context with different meeting IDs (mtg-7c15df84
      for debug, mtg-61ba1b5b for planning), showing the workflow effectively parallelized
      investigation and execution across concurrent meetings.
