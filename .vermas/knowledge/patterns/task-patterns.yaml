patterns:
- pattern: testing/*
  insights:
  - Task specified creating tests/parsers/test_claude.py with specific test cases,
    but the tests directory for parsers was never created. The dev agent focused solely
    on implementation code and skipped the test creation requirement entirely. Tasks
    should enumerate deliverables as a checklist that agents verify before signaling
    completion.

  insights:
  - BaseSession/ClaudeSession use Pydantic with sensible defaults (empty lists via
    Field(default_factory=list), optional timestamps, computed properties for duration).
    This enables parsing incomplete session data gracefully while maintaining type
    safety. The pattern allows future parser extensions (Cursor, Copilot) to share
    common interface.

  insights:
  - QA agent approval message explicitly states which commands were run and passed
    ('uv run session-insights --help and uv run pytest passed'). This provides evidence-based
    approval rather than subjective assessment, making it clear what was verified.

  insights:
  - Dev agent implemented ClaudeParser with 340+ lines of production code (claude.py,
    models.py) but failed to git add/commit before signaling done. QA validates committed
    code state, not working directory, causing the workflow to fail despite complete
    implementation. This is a repeated failure mode that needs explicit commit verification
    in the workflow.

  insights:
  - The error 'Child Workflow execution failed' in a 183-second workflow suggests
    the child workflow (likely the dev agent execution) timed out or crashed before
    completing all steps. Combined with untracked files, this indicates the agent
    ran out of turns/time before the commit step. Complex tasks need checkpointing
    or longer execution budgets.

    uses by ID, match tool_result entries to resolve them, handle multiple directory
    structure entry points (.claude, projects, direct), and use graceful error accumulation
    via parse_errors property rather than failing fast. This pattern enables reliable
    parsing of real-world session data.'

  insights:
  - When QA reports 'no implementation found' after dev claims completion, first run
    'git status' in the worktree. Untracked files indicate the dev agent completed
    the code but failed to commit. This is a common failure mode fixable by manually
    committing the orphaned files.
