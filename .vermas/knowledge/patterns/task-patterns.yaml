  - 'The Claude parser tests demonstrate good organization: separate test classes
    for model validation (TestClaudeSessionIndex, TestClaudeSession) and parser functionality
    (TestClaudeParser), plus integration tests for real data. This structure enables
    progressive validation from unit to integration level and should be replicated
    for future parsers.'

  insights:
  - Extract string templates to a dedicated templates.py module with Template objects
    and helper functions (format_tag, format_duration, etc.). The formatter class
    then focuses on data transformation while templates handle presentation, improving
    maintainability and testability.

  insights:
  - When dev signals completion, include specific metrics (test count, coverage percentage,
    files changed) to enable QA to quickly verify scope and prioritize review. This
    reduces QA investigation time and enables faster approval cycles.

  insights:
  - The watcher agent monitors both dev and QA progress, emitting status updates at
    key transitions (dev working, dev done, QA reviewing, QA approved). This creates
    a clear audit trail and helps identify bottlenecks in multi-agent workflows.

  insights:
  - The workflow detected 'agents died' for the dev role after 248 seconds. Long-running
    implementations without regular heartbeats can cause workflow infrastructure to
    terminate the agent. Agents should call heartbeat after completing each significant
    action (file creation, test run) and especially during long operations.
