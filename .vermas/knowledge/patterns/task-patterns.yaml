  - 'The test suite covered 17 scenarios including: valid session parsing, index-based
    parsing, tool call extraction, thinking content extraction, malformed JSON handling,
    empty files, nonexistent paths, and integration with real session structures.
    Testing edge cases upfront reduces QA rejection rate.'

  insights:
  - Project uses Click library for CLI with a main entry point and analyze subcommand.
    Entry point configured in pyproject.toml as session_insights.cli:main. This modular
    structure allows adding new subcommands without modifying the main CLI structure.

  insights:
  - QA agent approval message explicitly states which commands were run and passed
    ('uv run session-insights --help and uv run pytest passed'). This provides evidence-based
    approval rather than subjective assessment, making it clear what was verified.

  insights:
  - The watcher agent monitors both dev and QA progress, emitting status updates at
    key transitions (dev working, dev done, QA reviewing, QA approved). This creates
    a clear audit trail and helps identify bottlenecks in multi-agent workflows.

  insights:
  - The workflow detected 'agents died' for the dev role after 248 seconds. Long-running
    implementations without regular heartbeats can cause workflow infrastructure to
    terminate the agent. Agents should call heartbeat after completing each significant
    action (file creation, test run) and especially during long operations.

    classes for future parser extensions, Pydantic models with field aliases for JSON
    mapping, and graceful handling of multiple entry points (.claude dir, projects
    dir, or direct session files). This design enables adding new parsers (Cursor,
    Copilot) by extending the base classes.'
