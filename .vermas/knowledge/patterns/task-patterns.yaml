  - 'Use Click''s CliRunner fixture for CLI testing: test --help, --version, subcommand
    help, and required argument validation. These smoke tests catch integration issues
    early without requiring complex fixtures. Assert on exit_code and key output strings.'

  insights:
  - Use Click's @click.group() decorator to create a main command that serves as a
    container for subcommands. This provides clean --help output, --version support,
    and extensible command structure. Each subcommand gets its own function with @main.command()
    decorator.

  insights:
  - QA agent approval message explicitly states which commands were run and passed
    ('uv run session-insights --help and uv run pytest passed'). This provides evidence-based
    approval rather than subjective assessment, making it clear what was verified.

  insights:
  - MCP 'Connection refused' errors can cause agents to fail silently without sending
    workflow signals. Monitor MCP server health and implement retry logic. Tmux session
    crashes combined with MCP issues lead to complete coordination failure even when
    code work is successful.

  insights:
  - When agents fail to register with the workflow within a timeout period, the orchestrator
    should detect this early and log clear error messages. The root cause of this
    failure was agents never registering - checking tmux pane status after spawn could
    provide visibility into spawn failures.

    uses by ID, match tool_result entries to resolve them, handle multiple directory
    structure entry points (.claude, projects, direct), and use graceful error accumulation
    via parse_errors property rather than failing fast. This pattern enables reliable
    parsing of real-world session data.'

  insights:
  - QA agents should verify file existence independently of git status. Clean git
    status can mask uncommitted work that exists in the worktree. When reporting 'no
    implementation found', check both 'git status' AND file existence with ls/stat
    to provide accurate feedback.

    in the same file.
