patterns:
- pattern: testing/*
  insights:
  - QA couldn't verify coverage because pytest-cov wasn't installed in their environment.
    Dev reported 99% coverage but QA had to approve based on trust, not verification.
    Agent environments should have consistent test dependencies.

    Key elements to replicate: discovery method, session model extension, message
    extraction, tool usage extraction, and test structure. The dev signal explicitly

  insights:
  - MCP 'Connection refused' errors can cause agents to fail silently without sending
    workflow signals. Monitor MCP server health and implement retry logic. Tmux session
    crashes combined with MCP issues lead to complete coordination failure even when
    code work is successful.

  insights:
  - When agents fail to register with the workflow within a timeout period, the orchestrator
    should detect this early and log clear error messages. The root cause of this
    failure was agents never registering - checking tmux pane status after spawn could
    provide visibility into spawn failures.

  insights:
  - The dev agent initially investigated a 'failed' prior mission and discovered the
    code was complete but uncommitted. This debug meeting pattern - investigating
    artifacts before assuming failure - prevented duplicate work and identified the
    true root cause as orchestration issues.

  insights:
  - Workflows running over 10 minutes need active heartbeat monitoring to detect agent
    death before the full timeout. The dev agent died without signaling, causing the
    workflow to fail silently. Implementing periodic heartbeat checks (every 60-120
    seconds) would allow earlier detection and potential agent restart.

  insights:
  - When an agent dies mid-task, all progress is lost if no intermediate commits exist.
    Agents should checkpoint progress by committing partial work frequently (every
    significant change), enabling workflow resumption from the last checkpoint rather
    than restarting from scratch.

  insights:
  - The improvement logs indicate adding a 'validate' state before 'engineering' helps
    isolate environment/setup issues from implementation issues. Running a single-agent
    validation step first proves the execution environment works before spawning multiple
    agents, reducing complex failure modes.
