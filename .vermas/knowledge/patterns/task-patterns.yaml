patterns:
- pattern: testing/*
  insights:
  - Each analyzer class has a corresponding test class (TestSuccessFailureAnalyzer,
    TestTimelineAnalyzer, TestCrossSessionCorrelator) with fixtures for analyzer instances
    and tests covering empty input, minimal input below threshold, and pattern detection
    scenarios. This 1:1 mapping makes test coverage gaps obvious and maintenance straightforward.

  insights:
  - Using SHA256 hash of insight components (truncated to 12 chars) produces deterministic
    IDs that remain stable across runs for the same input data. This enables deduplication
    and tracking of insights across multiple analysis runs without requiring external
    ID generation.

  - QA caught pyproject.toml dependencies not matching TASK.md requirements. Comparing
    actual dependencies against spec is a high-value QA check that catches scope creep
    early. Always verify that installed dependencies match exactly what the spec requires.

  insights:
  - The workflow completed in ~6.5 minutes with dev producing 800 lines of analyzer
    code and 581 lines of tests, both properly committed to the repository. Unlike
    previous cycles where code existed but wasn't committed, this workflow verified
    deliverables were tracked in git before signaling done.

- pattern: implementation/*
  insights:
  - The pattern analyzer implementation uses an abstract BaseAnalyzer class with a
    required analyze() method, then implements three specialized analyzers (SuccessFailureAnalyzer,
    TimelineAnalyzer, CrossSessionCorrelator). This separation allows each analyzer
    to focus on one concern while sharing ID generation and common interfaces. A run_all_analyzers()
    convenience function orchestrates all analyzers and returns a unified InsightCollection.

  - Dev signaled done, QA found issues and signaled needs_revision, dev fixed and

    loop (dev fix in ~1 minute after QA review) is more efficient than multi-cycle
    iterations.

  insights:
  - Workflows running over 10 minutes need active heartbeat monitoring to detect agent
    death before the full timeout. The dev agent died without signaling, causing the
    workflow to fail silently. Implementing periodic heartbeat checks (every 60-120
    seconds) would allow earlier detection and potential agent restart.

  insights:
  - When an agent dies mid-task, all progress is lost if no intermediate commits exist.
    Agents should checkpoint progress by committing partial work frequently (every
    significant change), enabling workflow resumption from the last checkpoint rather
    than restarting from scratch.

  insights:
  - The improvement logs indicate adding a 'validate' state before 'engineering' helps
    isolate environment/setup issues from implementation issues. Running a single-agent
    validation step first proves the execution environment works before spawning multiple
    agents, reducing complex failure modes.

  insights:
  - Using Pydantic models with InsightType and InsightSeverity enums provides type
    safety and self-documenting code. The InsightCollection wrapper adds filter methods
    (filter_by_type, filter_by_severity, high_priority property) that make consumers'
    code cleaner and more expressive than manual list filtering.

  insights:
  - When parsing JSON files that may come from different sources, support common wrapper

    to direct arrays. This makes the parser resilient to variations in how tools export
    session data.

  insights:
  - When an agent completes its work and signals done/approved, but its process dies
    before the workflow orchestrator confirms termination, the entire workflow is
    marked as failed despite successful task completion. The orchestrator should check
    for completion signals before flagging agent death as workflow failure.

  insights:
  - Code committed to worktree branches does not automatically appear in main. After
    'git commit' in a worktree, you must explicitly merge or cherry-pick to main.
    The task completion signal was sent after the worktree commit, but the merge step
    was skipped, leaving the code stranded in the feature branch.

    in the task definition.
