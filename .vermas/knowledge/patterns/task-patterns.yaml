  - 'Use Click''s CliRunner fixture for CLI testing: test --help, --version, subcommand
    help, and required argument validation. These smoke tests catch integration issues
    early without requiring complex fixtures. Assert on exit_code and key output strings.'

  insights:
  - Use Click's @click.group() decorator to create a main command that serves as a
    container for subcommands. This provides clean --help output, --version support,
    and extensible command structure. Each subcommand gets its own function with @main.command()
    decorator.

  insights:
  - QA agent approval message explicitly states which commands were run and passed
    ('uv run session-insights --help and uv run pytest passed'). This provides evidence-based
    approval rather than subjective assessment, making it clear what was verified.

  insights:
  - The error 'Child Workflow execution failed' in a 183-second workflow suggests
    the child workflow (likely the dev agent execution) timed out or crashed before
    completing all steps. Combined with untracked files, this indicates the agent
    ran out of turns/time before the commit step. Complex tasks need checkpointing
    or longer execution budgets.

  insights:
  - QA agent relied solely on git status being clean to determine no implementation
    existed. However, the files were present but untracked. QA could check for file
    existence in addition to git status to provide more accurate feedback and detect
    uncommitted work.

    uses by ID, match tool_result entries to resolve them, handle multiple directory
    structure entry points (.claude, projects, direct), and use graceful error accumulation
    via parse_errors property rather than failing fast. This pattern enables reliable
    parsing of real-world session data.'

  insights:
  - When QA reports 'no implementation found', check if files exist but are untracked
    vs truly missing. Git status shows clean but files may exist in worktree. QA should
    run both 'git status' and file existence checks to provide accurate feedback about
    the actual state.
