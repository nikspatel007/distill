patterns:
- pattern: testing/*
  insights:
  - When adding caches to prevent duplicate processing (like _vermas_parsed_dirs to
    prevent re-parsing the same .vermas directory), always expose a reset_vermas_cache()
    function to clear the cache between tests. This prevents test pollution while
    maintaining production performance.

  insights:
  - When integrating multiple parsers that return different session models, create
    a conversion function (_convert_parser_session_to_base) that maps parser-specific
    messages to a common interface (ConversationTurn). This enables features like
    --include-conversation to work uniformly across all parser types without modifying
    the parsers themselves.

  insights:
  - Complex integration tasks require multiple QA review cycles. First review catches
    architectural gaps (missing parser dispatch, incomplete directory scanning). Second
    review catches functional gaps (message-to-turn mapping for conversation display,
    deduplication logic). Each QA signal should include specific issues and working
    test commands.

    code and 581 lines of tests, both properly committed to the repository. Unlike
    previous cycles where code existed but wasn't committed, this workflow verified
    deliverables were tracked in git before signaling done.

  insights:
  - The pattern analyzer implementation uses an abstract BaseAnalyzer class with a
    required analyze() method, then implements three specialized analyzers (SuccessFailureAnalyzer,
    TimelineAnalyzer, CrossSessionCorrelator). This separation allows each analyzer
    to focus on one concern while sharing ID generation and common interfaces. A run_all_analyzers()
    convenience function orchestrates all analyzers and returns a unified InsightCollection.

  - Workflows running over 10 minutes need active heartbeat monitoring to detect agent
    death before the full timeout. The dev agent died without signaling, causing the
    workflow to fail silently. Implementing periodic heartbeat checks (every 60-120
    seconds) would allow earlier detection and potential agent restart.

    code cleaner and more expressive than manual list filtering.
