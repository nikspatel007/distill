patterns:
- pattern: testing/*
  insights:
  - When adding caches to prevent duplicate processing (like _vermas_parsed_dirs to
    prevent re-parsing the same .vermas directory), always expose a reset_vermas_cache()
    function to clear the cache between tests. This prevents test pollution while
    maintaining production performance.

  insights:
  - Complex integration tasks benefit from iterative QA reviews. First review catches
    architectural gaps (missing dispatch, incomplete scanning). Second review catches
    functional gaps (message-to-turns mapping, deduplication). Dev signals 'done'
    after each fix; QA signals 'needs_revision' or 'approved' with specific issues.

    code and 581 lines of tests, both properly committed to the repository. Unlike
    previous cycles where code existed but wasn't committed, this workflow verified
    deliverables were tracked in git before signaling done.

  insights:
  - The pattern analyzer implementation uses an abstract BaseAnalyzer class with a
    required analyze() method, then implements three specialized analyzers (SuccessFailureAnalyzer,
    TimelineAnalyzer, CrossSessionCorrelator). This separation allows each analyzer
    to focus on one concern while sharing ID generation and common interfaces. A run_all_analyzers()
    convenience function orchestrates all analyzers and returns a unified InsightCollection.

  insights:
  - Workflows running over 10 minutes need active heartbeat monitoring to detect agent
    death before the full timeout. The dev agent died without signaling, causing the
    workflow to fail silently. Implementing periodic heartbeat checks (every 60-120
    seconds) would allow earlier detection and potential agent restart.

  insights:

    Agents should checkpoint progress by committing partial work frequently (every

    than restarting from scratch.

    code cleaner and more expressive than manual list filtering.

    was skipped, leaving the code stranded in the feature branch.
