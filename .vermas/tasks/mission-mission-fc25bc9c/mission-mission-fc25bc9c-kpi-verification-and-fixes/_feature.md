# kpi-verification-and-fixes

The prior evaluation explicitly recommended running programmatic KPI verification as the FIRST task. This plan leads with measurement (task 1), then parallelizes three independent fix tracks (tasks 2-4) based on measured baselines, and concludes with final verification (task 5). The session-insights squad is the correct fit since all work targets the session-insights tool. Tasks 2, 3, and 4 can run in parallel after the baseline is established since they target independent KPIs (project names, narratives, weekly digests + coverage). The final verification task depends on all three fix tasks completing. This avoids the prior pattern of completing tasks without verified measurements.
