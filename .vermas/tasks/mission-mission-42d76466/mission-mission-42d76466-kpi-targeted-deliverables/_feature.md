# kpi-targeted-deliverables

Prior cycles completed 60 tasks but KPI progress stalled at 40%, indicating the work was foundational/scaffolding that didn't produce measurable deliverables. Following the evaluator's explicit guidance: (1) prioritize tests_pass first as it's easiest to measure and validates everything else, (2) break work into KPI-specific tasks with measurable targets, (3) include measurement scripts so the evaluator gets real numbers. Tasks are ordered so test fixes come first, then project detection (unlocks both project notes and weekly digests which can run in parallel), and narrative summaries can also start after tests pass. Each task maps directly to one or more KPIs and mission deliverables. Using the 'session-insights' squad as it's the most established squad for this project domain.
